# Project4_WebStyleGuide

In this project, I created rules to style the a pre-existing web page using only element class names already established. I learned to utilize SASS for this project, using partials, variables, extends, and mixins to apply the styles and classes to the style guide page. I now have a SASS micro-framework to quickly prototype other websites.
